##### Part I: Basic Filtering #####

# Create the connection
# Note the connect is 'conn1' since there will be multiple .db used

# Select all
display = pd.read_sql("""SELECT * FROM planets; """, conn1)

# STEP 1
# Replace None with your code

##### Part 2: Advanced Filtering #####

# STEP 3
# Replace None with your code
df_mass = pd.read_sql("""
SELECT name, mass
FROM planets

""", conn1)
print(df_mass)
# STEP 4

##### Part 3: Ordering and Limiting #####

# STEP 0

##### Part 4: Aggregation #####

# STEP 0

conn3 = sqlite3.connect('babe_ruth.db')

# Select all

##### Part 5: Grouping and Aggregation #####

# STEP 11
# Replace None with your code
df_teams_years = pd.read_sql("""
SELECT team, COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS number_years
